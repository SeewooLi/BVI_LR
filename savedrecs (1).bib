Abstract = {Braille literacy is one of the core pillars of education for visually
   impaired children. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of
   Braille for Visually impaired children by suggesting that students who
   read Braille outside of the classroom have higher reading speed and
   fluency. In resource constrained countries, such as Pakistan, the
   visually impaired students may acquire the knowledge of Urdu Braille at
   special education schools. However, there is a dearth of resources for
   the parents of such children, when it comes to learning Urdu Braille.
   Therefore, we designed a web-based Urdu Braille Translator and
   interactive Braille learning tool to enhance the Urdu Braille learning
   experience for parents of visually impaired. The usability study of this
   tool was conducted with 15 parents of the visually impaired students.},

Abstract = {Braille literacy has fallen in recent years, and many blind children now
   grow up without learning Braille. However, learning Braille can increase
   employment chances and improve literacy skills. We introduce
   BrailleBlocks, a system to help visually impaired children learn and
   practice Braille alongside a sighted parent. BrailleBlocks comprises a
   set of tangible blocks and pegs, each block representing a Braille cell,
   and an associated application with games. The system automatically
   tracks and recognizes the blocks so that parents can follow along even
   if they cannot read Braille. We conducted a user study to test
   BrailleBlocks with five families, with five parents and six visually
   impaired children. The contributions of this work are a novel approach
   to Braille education toys, observations of how visually impaired
   children and sighted parents used this system together, their insights
   on current issues with Braille educational tools, and actionable
   feedback for future Braille-based learning tools.},

Abstract = {Literacy rates of visually impaired people in modern development country
   are being concerned nowadays. Early education for children with visual
   impairments is said to be one of the factors. Learning Braille is no
   longer a boring lesson to visually impaired children. This paper
   mediated a new pathway to interlink and translates inputs from keyboard
   into the most used Braille character automatically and enables normal
   visually people to have real time interaction with visually impaired
   person. This system also can be switches to Arabic Braille character to
   introduce them with Quran language. The output was able to represent
   each alphabet, number and Arabic letter of the Braille symbol by
   mechanically raising and lowering pins to create the tactile dots of
   Braille using solenoid. This method is a low cost, portable, and easy to
   operate. Experiments show that the method can effectively convert a
   keyboard as an input into Braille symbol.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the well-documented importance of braille for people who
   are blind or visually impaired, few studies explore technology for
   facilitating braille literacy education. Evaluations of the impact of
   using assistive devices on academics for children and youth who are
   blind or visually impaired are needed. This systematic review aimed to
   evaluate the effectiveness of technology used to support braille
   literacy education for children and youth. Materials and methods The
   population of interest was defined as children and youth aged 0-21 years
   who were blind or visually impaired, learning literacy through braille
   as their primary medium, and had not previously learned to read through
   sighted methods. Sixteen academic education, health sciences,
   multidisciplinary, rehabilitation, and engineering databases were
   searched. Results Twelve peer-reviewed, English-language articles were
   included in the review evaluating a total of 176 participants. In
   general, the quality of research was low with little evidence to support
   the use of current technology for braille literacy education.
   Conclusions Standards of technology evaluation for braille literacy must
   be developed. Furthermore, assistive technologies for braille literacy
   education for children and youth should provide real-time auditory and
   tactile feedback, enable independent study/practice and editing of work,
   and be easy to use, motivational, and engaging.},

   through the integration of technologies and didactic tools to ease and
   enhance the education experience in and outside of the classroom. After
   a survey in several welfare centers, it was revealed that the visually

   In this work, we introduce Slate Master, a mobile device didactic tool
   for the visually impaired designed to ease learning how to use the
   Braille slate. The Braille slate is a tool used by the visually impaired
   to manually write Braille encoded text on paper. Slate Master is
   composed by a Braille tutor mobile application and a custom input
   interface that mimics the use of the Braille slate. We also present the
   insights obtained from a preliminary study performed with six Braille
   education experts that led to the design and development of Slate
   Master.},

Abstract = {. Purpose: The aim of the study was to estimate the occurrence,
   diagnoses and time trends among Norwegian children that have received
   education in braille from 1967 to 2007. Methods: We used a retrospective
   population-based study design. The health care system is free for all
   inhabitants in Norway. We included all children that had received
   braille education the last four decades. From each students record, we
   abstracted year born, country of birth, gender, year diagnosed,
   diagnosis, classification of visual impairment and type of reading
   media. Results: We identified 287 children (137 girls and 150 boys) that
   had received braille education over the last 40 years. Of these, 262
   (91.3\%) children were born in Norway, 145 (53.7\%) were diagnosed
   within the first year of life and 59 (20.6\%) from age of one to five.
   The most frequent diagnoses were Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP),
   Juvenile Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (JNCL), Lebers Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)
   and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). Among the children, 63\% (N = 170) used
   braille only, 9\% (N = 25) braille and print, but priority braille, and
   27\% (N = 73) braille and print, priority print. The number of children
   with ROP using braille had a peak in 1977, then the number declined. The
   number diagnosed with LCA increased from 1987 to 1992. The number of
   braille users among children diagnosed with JNCL tended to increase
   substantially after 1992. Conclusion: Braille education seemed to be
   dependent of trends in diagnoses as well as trends in recommendations
   from professional educators.},

Abstract = {Objective. This article gives an analysis of what a good automatic
   Braille transcribing tool should propose to be suitable for inclusive
   education. We criticize actual technologies and we present NAT Braille,
   a free software solution designed to respond to pedagogical specific
   needs.
   Main content. We describe the situation of inclusive education for
   visually-impaired students in France and recall the main existing
   solutions. We then focus on two major facts : most teachers are not
   skilled in Braille and only few solutions are designed to teach Braille
   inside a classroom. Moreover, teachers and students need to communicate
   directly without the support of transcribing centers, which produce high
   quality transcriptions but are inadequate during a lesson or to
   communicate for students working together. NAT Braille is a transcribing
   tool that has been designed to limit the time disability which is
   prejudicial to the visually impaired, especially during the learning
   process. It includes features allowing teachers to transcribe
   automatically composite documents according to pedagogical scenarios,
   particularly while learning contracted Braille (there are different
   steps corresponding to the student's level in contracted Braille, also
   usable by a non Braille reading teacher). It contains a simple Braille
   and black interface where students and teacher may interact directly and
   produce instant Braille to black or black to Braille transcriptions,
   including mathematical and contracted Braille ones. Therefore NAT
   Braille allows immediate corrections, group work and mutual assistance
   between students. Moreover users can read and write with their own
   modalities and language. NAT Braille uses a highly customizable set of
   rules instead of dictionaries, and adapts to each profile.
   Results. NAT Braille has been tested in real environments and will now
   be widely distributed into classes. Feedbacks are promising and raise
   new challenges, especially to make the software even more simple to use.
   Some features could be combined with other existing solutions to improve
   the understanding of formulas, to ease the transcriptions' edition or to
   include NAT Braille in publishing chains in order to produce adaptable
   documents.
   Conclusion. We show that NAT Braille is a good solution for inclusive
   education, particularly in the case of non Braille reading teachers. In
   this idea we are developing foreign partnerships to propose NAT Braille
   into other languages. However it remains a tool and would be advantaged
   if combined with other assistive solutions. We must see it as a first
   step towards developing other assistive tools for Braille learning and
   transcribing.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
   (CRPD) affirms a right to education for disabled persons and aims to
   ensure braille instruction for blind individuals. However, there is
   evidence that braille instruction is often circumvented or abandoned
   early in CRPD nations because it is perceived as an inefficient learning
   medium for blind students. This perception persists despite insufficient
   empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of the efficiency of
   reading versus listening for learning in sighted individuals. We
   therefore investigated the efficiency of learning written versus spoken
   words in blind and sighted samples. Participants (23 blind, 20 sighted)
   studied the written definitions of 70 rare English words in successive
   rounds, presented in conjunction with written or spoken wordforms. Blind
   participants learned with equal efficiency across modalities, whereas
   sighted participants learned spoken words more efficiently. The findings
   indicate the inefficiency argument against teaching braille is
   groundless, both because braille word learning is not less efficient
   than auditory word learning for blind individuals, and because reading
   is valued in the education of sighted individuals despite its apparent
   inefficiency in that population.},

Abstract = {Braille readers use a braille display and text-to-speech synthesizer
   while reading and comprehending mathematical expressions and equations.
   Teachers need to have technological, pedagogical and content (TPACK)
   knowledge and skills for exploiting the potential of these devices in
   mathematics education. They have to understand how the use of assistive
   technology influences the teaching and learning of mathematics.
   Therefore, the aim of the current study is to support teachers to better
   understand the dynamic relation between the different TPACK domains.
   That is why a professional development course was developed in which
   five mathematics teachers of braille readers in special secondary
   education participated. The development of the teachers' TPACK knowledge
   was analyzed, and course characteristics that helped to develop this
   knowledge were identified. The results show an increased awareness of
   the importance of assistive devices, but only a small positive effect in
   TPACK knowledge and skills. Course activities related to the braille
   display, the mathematical braille notation and mathematical vocabulary
   helped to develop TPACK knowledge. However, course activities related to
   the text-to-speech synthesizer and working in heterogeneous groups did
   not work out so well. A better understanding of what teaching
   mathematics to braille readers means is expected to improve their
   learning.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Parents who were the primary caretakers of children in the
   Alphabetic and Contracted Braille Study (ABC Braille Study) revealed
   their perspectives about braille literacy. Methods: A 30-item
   questionnaire was constructed by the ABC Braille research team, and
   researchers conducted telephone interviews with 31 parents who were the
   primary caregivers of children in the ABC Braille Study. The questions
   investigated how often the parents read to their children, whether print
   or braille books were available at home, what their primary goals were
   for their children, and whether they knew braille. The data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics. Demographic information was also
   gathered and analyzed. Last, the parents were separated into two groups
   on the basis of the students' achievement, and data on the parents of
   the high-achieving students were compared with data on the parents of
   the low-achieving students. Results: The data from the interviews showed
   that the participants often read to their children and provided them
   with some braille books. The primary goals of the parents were that
   their children learn to read and write braille, and the parents
   indicated that braille would be the primary medium throughout their
   children's lives. Although many parents knew at least the braille
   alphabet (20 of the 31 participants), only 3 of the 31 indicated that
   they know contracted braille. The findings revealed a slight
   relationship between the parents' level of education and the children's
   reading performance. Discussion.. The participants placed a high value
   on supporting literacy at home by reading to their children, learning
   some braille, and providing their children with books. However, the
   availability of braille books at home was limited in comparison to the
   availability of print books, and the participants' knowledge of
   contracted braille was limited. Implications for Practitioners: The
   involvement of parents is critical to promoting positive literacy
   experiences at home. Teachers of students with visual impairments are
   regarded as the primary support persons who provide resources for
   parents of children who are learning braille, including resources for
   learning braille and braille materials for use at home.},

   innovation laboratories of the Ministry of Special Education through its
   braille Corner and the Indonesian Braille Literacy Center (BLBI) with
   its digital literacy resources for students with visual impairment.
   Content and empirical validation were carried out through the Delphi
   technique, to obtain the content formulation, efficiency, and
   implementation of the model that has the principle of feasibility.
   Empirical validation was carried out through Focus Group Discussions
   with practitioners to obtain input on the application of the model. The
   results of the study found a digital literacy-based learning innovation
   model ``braille corner{''} for students with visual impairment that
   answered the importance of a support system for students with visual
   impairment through the realization of equality and accessibility for
   students with visual impairment through digital literacy braille Corner.
   With the hope of realizing an inclusive education setting in the

Abstract = {Background Beginning readers are typically introduced to enlarged print,
   and the size of this print decreases as readers become more fluent. In
   comparison, beginning blind readers are expected to learn standard-sized
   Braille from the outset because past research suggests letter knowledge
   cannot be transferred across different sizes of Braille. Aims The study
   aims to investigate whether learning Braille using an oversized pegboard
   leads to faster, transferable, letter learning and whether performance
   is mediated by either tactile or visual learning. Sample Sixty-eight
   children participated in the study. All children were sighted
   pre-readers with no previous knowledge of Braille. The children came
   from two nursery schools with an average age of 47.8 months. Methods
   Children were taught specific Braille letters using either an enlarged
   pegboard or standard Braille. Two other groups of children were taught
   using visually presented Braille characters in either an enlarged or
   standard size and a further control group mirrored the experience of
   blind children in receiving non-specific tactile training prior to being
   introduced to Braille. In all tactile conditions it was ensured that the
   children did not visually experience any Braille for the duration of the
   study. Results
   Results demonstrated that initially training children with large Braille
   tactually led to the best subsequent learning of standard Braille.
   Despite the fact that both initial visual and large tactual learning
   were significantly faster than learning standard Braille, when
   transferring letter knowledge to standard tactile Braille, previous
   tactile experience with the large pegboard offered the most efficient
   route. Conclusions Braille letter knowledge can be transferred across
   size and modality particularly effectively with large tactile Braille.
   This has significant implications for the education of blind children.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigation of the attitudes of
   undergraduate students of special education department and other
   education faculty students towards Braille writing. This research is
   descriptive. Sociodemographic data were collected online from 311
   special education and other education faculty undergraduate students who
   voluntarily participated in the study and whose consent was obtained,
   using a sociodemographic data collection form and the Attitude Scale
   Towards Braille Writing (ASTBW). In statistical analyses, t test,
   one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Cronbach's alpha reliability
   coefficient were calculated using SPSS 25.0 data analysis software. It
   was determined that 71.1\% of the participants were female and 24.1\%
   were male. About 52.4\% of them were students of special education
   teaching department. According to the mean scores obtained, the
   participants' beliefs were at a medium level, their interest and desire
   were at a high level, and their desire to learn was at a very high
   level. It was found that there were significant differences between the
   sociodemographic descriptive information of the students in the
   undergraduate department of special education and other education
   faculties and their attitudes towards Braille. It was stated that the
   attitudes of the students in the undergraduate of special education
   department and other education faculties towards Braille writing varied.
   It is thought that it will be a guide to conduct research in the related
   field to include other departments in the faculty of education.},

Abstract = {While sighted mathematicians have long accepted the need for a uniform
   way of writing math, the situation amongst the blind is different:
   Rather than standardising, the tradition has been to develop language-,
   country-or even institution-specific codes for expressing math in
   Braille in addition to the national Braille codes for literary Braille.
   Using the RoboBraille service as a foundation, the paper describes an
   automated and flexible system that can shred, transcribe and reassemble
   documents containing math into Braille. Using existing components, the
   Braille Math extension to RoboBraille enables Braille readers to mix and
   match amongst supported national Braille codes and Braille math regimes,
   including Braille math systems like Nemeth and Marburg, and mainstream
   formats such as LaTeX and MathML. Finally, the paper discusses how the
   system may be enhanced to handle charts, graphs and tables.},

Title = {The Orientation and Mobility Specialist and Braille: Point-Counter Point
   Arguments for and Against the Need for the Knowledge of Braille},

Abstract = {Introduction: Few academic discussions are more contentious in the field
   of orientation and mobility than the notion of whether or not O\&M
   specialists need to know braille. To help answer this question, we
   developed a survey. Methods: An online survey instrument was distributed
   through O\&M electronic discussion groups. The survey included a
   demographic section, a section concerning the use of braille for
   instructional purposes, questions about the importance of braille in the
   training and certification of O\&M specialists, the level of knowledge
   of braille required, and whether or not respondents considered braille
   an essential job function. Results: Most participants (n = I 08)
   believed or strongly believed that braille should be a separate course
   in personnel preparation programs and should be required for O\&M
   personnel preparation programs accredited by the Association for
   Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired (AER).
   Slightly less than half (42\%) of respondents believed or strongly
   believed that braille should be required for Academy for Certification
   of Vision Rehabilitation and Education Professionals (ACVREP)
   certification in O\&M (n = 80; 22 respondents were undecided).
   Discussion: The field of visual impairment (i.e., blindness or low
   vision) needs to examine closely the amount of time, number of personnel
   required, and financial cost of pursuing braille as a competency for
   O\&M specialists. Personnel costs may include additional resources to
   assist ACVREP in changing its requirements to include braille and the
   revision of the examination to reflect this new requirement,
   universities in hiring faculty to develop new programs of study to
   include coursework involving braille, and AER's Higher Education
   Accreditation Commission in changing the AER University Review
   Accreditation Curricular Standards: Orientation and Mobility
   Specialists. Implications for practitioners: This study provided a
   snapshot of what a group (N = 1 89) of vision professionals believe
   regarding the importance of braille in O\&M-141 of that group were
   certified in O \& M; the remainder identified themselves as having
   multiple certifications. Further research is needed, especially
   including more representation of rehabilitation professionals, to obtain
   more input concerning this controversial topic.},

Journal = {DISPLAYS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The education of visually impaired children remains a focal topic, and
   the implementation of Braille-Chinese translation can facilitate
   improved understanding and learning of Braille for these children.
   Braille-Chinese translation refers to the conversion of Braille text
   into Chinese characters. Owing to the scarcity of Braille- Chinese
   parallel corpora, achieving Braille-Chinese translation with limited
   data remains a significant research challenge. This study tackles the
   challenge by utilizing both Braille joint training and pre -trained
   language models to conduct analogy learning and transfer learning on a
   substantial volume of readily available data. The method of Braille
   joint training also establishes a universal language model in the
   Braille domain, capable of simultaneously performing multiple tasks like
   Braille-Chinese translation, Chinese-Braille translation, Braille word
   segmentation, etc. This greatly caters to users' requirements for
   Braille information processing while also mitigating extensive
   deployment expenses associated with multiple models. Furthermore, we put
   forward a Braille phoneme recognition translation approach distinct from
   conventional Braille-Chinese translation methodologies. This approach
   aims to attain precise translation by identifying the Chinese characters
   corresponding to each Braille phoneme. This method achieves a BLEU score
   of 96.22 on the Braille-Chinese entity annotation dataset and exhibits
   high translation efficiency.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of IPA Braille, revised and updated by
   Englebretson (2008) under the auspices of the International Council on
   English Braille (ICEB). After a brief introduction to braille as a
   writing system and a review of the disparate braille notations formerly
   used for phonetics, the author discusses the need for a single,
   up-to-date, linguistically-informed braille notation for the IPA. The
   author then outlines the rationale and procedures used in developing IPA
   Braille, and presents ail appendix of the complete charts showing the
   braille equivalents for all symbols of the current IPA(revised to 2005).
   This article is relevant to phoneticians interested in applications of
   the IPA, linguists interested in writing systems, instructors who may
   have blind Students enrolled in phonetics and linguistics courses, and
   especially to blind students and professionals needing access to a
   complete, updated braille IPA notation. The publication of the full
   braille charts in JIPA ensures that IPA Braille is available to the
   wider community of phoneticians and linguists, who typically do not have
   access to the literature from specialized braille publishing houses.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on how to improve accessibility for Braille readers
   on Internet. We criticize actual technologies and show their limits in
   scientific Braille and Braille personnalization, especially in
   pedagogical situations. We present NAT Braille, a free software solution
   designed to respond to pedagogical specific needs. The transcribing
   process uses a set of customizable XSLT transformations and several XML
   formats. We detail the design of NAT Braille and the technologies used
   for transcriptions. Then we explain why NAT Braille improves
   personnalization in Braille rendering on Internet. We give the example
   of our Mozilla extension which is able to transcribe web pages including
   MathML markup, and is set up with adapted transcription rules taking
   into account the user's preferences. We conclude by raising issues
   related to our work.},

Abstract = {The Braille system is a tactile format of written communication for
   visually-impaired people worldwide. Early days Braille embossed on
   papers done manually and now use machines as well. Sighted people do not
   understand these codes. Sighted society motivated the development of
   Optical Braille Recognition for different languages such as English,
   Arabic, and Chinese. Mostly, in Sri Lankan context, this problem occurs
   in education systems such as universities, schools because the documents
   written by blind students such as exam papers, evaluation works has to
   send to a braille translator before marking. This research addresses the
   issue of written communication gap between Sinhala blind and sighted
   people. Braille dots composing characters are identified on single sided
   documents of average quality with maximum accuracy. Work present
   executable system including proposed methods in order to transcript to
   recognized braille characters. Introduce of new extraction methods of
   Braille characters from a Braille document and decoding them into
   Sinhala characters. Then the decoded Sinhala characters are normalized
   to Sinhala text which is in human-understandable form.},

Abstract = {Braille is one of the major tools for teaching the visually impaired.
   Sufficient number of teachers engaged in special education involved in
   Filipino Braille is not available. One of the possible approaches to
   address this problem is the use of computers in automation of extracting
   information in Braille that can facilitate teaching. Other countries
   have taken their initiative to develop similar technology capable of
   teaching Braille however the Filipino Braille code including its
   contractions, and the Filipino language per se has features that are
   distinct to other languages. This research proposes a system that use
   machine vision in recognizing one-cell Filipino Braille contractions.
   Scanned Braille images undergo image processing and HOG feature
   extraction to train the system classifier thru SVM. Performance
   evaluation results reflect a high accuracy of recognition.},

Abstract = {Braille display is a device from which the visually challenged people
   can tactually read the text output from the computer in the form of
   Braille character. Braille has more advantages over synthetic speech
   because Braille has an important role in enhancing education, employment
   and income. But the commercially available Braille display price is in
   the range of (sic) 100000 to (sic) 500000 so it can't be easily avail
   for poor visually challenged people. So, this paper discusses about the
   making of new type of Braille display, by rotating multi-octagonal
   segments, with low cost. Here the text is converted into Braille
   character by rotating each octagonal segment, which contains all
   possible combination of raised dots of one column of Braille cell on its
   faces, to a particular degree. The required Braille character appears on
   the top face of the octagonal segments. This paper further discusses
   about the mechanical design of new Braille display, converting text into
   corresponding degree of rotation by using MATLAB, transferring that
   estimated degree to Arduino board and controlling the stepper motors to
   achieve the correct output (Braille characters).},

Abstract = {Visually impaired students (VIS) are unable to get visual information,
   which has made their learning process complicated. This paper discusses
   the overall situation of VIS in Bangladesh and identifies major
   challenges that they are facing in getting education. The Braille system
   is followed to educate blind students in Bangladesh. However, lack of
   Braille based educational resources and technological solutions have
   made the learning process lengthy and complicated for VIS. As a
   developing country, Bangladesh cannot afford for the costly Braille
   related technological tools for VIS. Therefore, a mobile phone based
   Braille application, mBRAILLE, for Android platform is designed to
   provide an easy Braille learning technology for VIS in Bangladesh. The
   proposed design is evaluated by experts in assistive technology for
   students with disabilities, and advanced learners of Braille. The
   application aims to provide a Bangla and English Braille learning
   platform for VIS. In this paper, we depict iterative (participatory)
   design of the application along with a preliminary evaluation with 5
   blind subjects, and 1 sighted and 2 blind experts. The results show that
   the design scored an overall satisfaction level of 4.53 out of 5 by all
   respondents, indicating that our design is ready for the next step of

   comprehension to identify instructional strategies used to increase
   reading comprehension. Only 12 studies met inclusion criteria,
   highlighting a void in the literature. Three small groups of literature
   emerged examining (a) factors affecting braille reading comprehension,
   (b) comparisons between students reading braille and students with
   normal vision reading print, and (c) instructional strategies to
   increase braille reading comprehension. These studies were situated in
   an existing model of reading comprehension to describe the status of
   reading research for braille readers and provide direction for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Blind children are the children with weak eyesight or complete loss of
   vision. Limitation of vision affects their ability to gain knowledge
   regarding oral health which will affect their oral hygiene status. This
   aim of this research is to determine the difference in effectiveness of
   dental health education between the audio and Braille method towards the
   knowledge and OHIs score among the blind children. This is an
   experimental research with pre and post test group design. This research
   comprised of 93 samples which were divided into two groups such as audio
   group (44 samples) and Braille group (49 samples) according to the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. The knowledge and oral hygiene score
   were individually evaluated using questionnaire and OHIs index. The
   evaluation was taken before, on the 1st week and 1 month after the
   dental health education. Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney test were used
   to analyze the difference in effectiveness of dental health education
   between the audio and Braille method. The results showed that there was
   a significant increase in knowledge score and decrease in OHIs score in
   both method (p=0.000). There was no significant differences in gaining
   knowledge and decreasing the oral hygiene score between the both methods
   (p>0.05). Therefore, dental health education using the audio and Braille
   is effective in improving the knowledge and oral hygiene score among the
   blind children.},

Abstract = {Aim: To assess the effect of oral health education (OHE) in the form of
   Braille and combination with Oral health talk (OHT) on oral hygiene
   knowledge, practices, and status of 12-17 years old visually impaired
   school girls in Pune city. Materials and Methods: A 6-week comparative
   study was conducted among 74 residential visually impaired school girls
   aged 12-17 years, who were trained to read Braille. The participants
   were divided into two groups, namely, Group A (n = 37) receiving OHE
   only in the form of Braille and Group B (n = 37) receiving OHE in form
   of Braille and OHT at baseline, 2, and 4-week interval. Oral health
   knowledge was assessed using a self-administered, pre-validated,
   pre-tested questionnaire typed in Marathi Braille. Assessment of oral
   hygiene practices and status was done using standardized proforma and
   simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S), respectively, at baseline and at
   the end of 6 weeks. Data was analyzed using paired and unpaired
   Student's t-test. Results: The results showed a statistically
   significant increase in oral health knowledge levels in Group B (4.95
   +/- 1.66) as compared to Group A (2.97 +/- 1.28). There was a
   significant increase in the frequency of mouth-rinsing in Group B
   (97.3\%) as compared to Group A (86.5\%) as well as in the tongue
   cleaning practice in Group B (100\%) as compared to Group A (81.1\%) at
   the end of 6 weeks. Conclusion: OHE in the form of Braille and OHT was
   more effective than OHE using only Braille.},

Abstract = {This study clarifies a previously established method in which Braille
   reading novices obtained Braille information aurally. Therein, users
   touched the vicinity of the Braille with a pen-type interface
   characterized by a Braille-to-voice function. Two-dimensional (2D) dot
   codes were printed on the Braille paper, and voice information
   corresponding to Braille was linked to these dot codes. This study aims
   to establish quantitative data regarding an acceptable size for the 2D
   dot code printing area. Nine Braille reading sighted novices,
   blindfolded and without Braille reading experience, were recruited to
   participate in an experiment, where they were asked to identify which of
   the six dots in a Braille character were missing, touch the pen-type
   interface to a sheet layered with the dot code printing area and TRUCT
   Braille, and evaluate the system's effectiveness on a scale from 1 to 5.
   All participants correctly identified the missing dot. Participants gave
   the Braille-to-voice function an average effectiveness rating of
   4.6/5.0, with a standard deviation of 0.7. A dot code printing area was
   determined to be 8 mm above and 10 mm below the midpoint between dots 2
   and 5 of the Braille character, with a width of 16 mm from the midpoint
   of the Braille. Based on these results, design guidelines were
   identified for the dot code printing area to improve the success rate of
   obtaining voice information corresponding to the Braille with the
   pen-type interface equipped with the Braille-to-voice function. This has
   numerous potential applications in Braille education methods for Braille
   reading novices.},

Abstract = {Learning Braille for visual impairments means being able to read, write
   and communicate with others. There exist several educational tools for
   learning Braille. Unfortunately, for Arabic Braille, there is a lack of
   interactive educational tools and what is mostly used is the traditional
   learning tools, such as the Braille block. Replacing those tools with
   some more effective and interactive e-learning tools would help to
   improve the learning process. This paper introduces a new educational
   system with a tangible and interactive interface. This system aims to
   help blind children to learn Arabic Braille letters and numbers using an
   interactive tactile Braille keypad together with the educational
   website. The interactive tactile Braille keypad was built using an
   Arduino connected with the educational website. A usability test was
   conducted and results showed that the system is easy to use and
   suggested that using the interactive Braille keypad with the educational
   website will improve the learning outcomes for blind children.},

Title = {Current use of contracted and uncontracted French braille in Quebec},

Abstract = {In the French braille code, becoming an efficient contracted braille
   user requires a considerable investment in time and effort. Students
   must learn 1217 abbreviations to allow time-and space-saving, but
   practitioners are questioning whether this investment is worthwhile. The
   purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of contracted braille
   use by adults and their perceptions about the importance of this code. A
   total of 23 Quebec braille users (aged 18-40 years) completed a
   telephone interview with quantitative questions about the frequency of
   their braille use, and their use of technologies as well as qualitative
   items regarding their perceptions of braille now and in the future, 12
   of whom completed a brief braille reading test. In all, 85\% of
   participants used uncontracted braille for reading, 59\% used contracted
   braille, and 95\% used text-to-speech. Contracted braille was used
   mostly for tasks that require continuous reading (e.g. novels). All
   except one recognized the need to learn uncontracted braille and 78\%
   considered contracted braille useful. In all, 11 participants indicated
   that they ``can read faster{''} with contracted braille, a finding that
   was not replicated by our reading test, whereby reading speeds were not
   statistically significantly different between the two conditions. The
   portrait that emerges from the current use of contracted French braille
   in Quebec indicates that it is not often used in the life of blind
   individuals. However, the faith of our participants in the relevance of
   the contracted code is still very strong. This may be explained by the
   fact that braille is part of their identity. The potential increase in
   reading speed with contracted braille may not justify the time, effort,
   and cognitive resources required to learn/teach this code in French. The
   educational challenge remains to find the proper balance between the
   uses of French braille versus other technologies such as text-to-speech.},
