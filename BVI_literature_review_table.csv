"Iqbal, Muhammad Zahid; Shahid, Suleman; Naseem, Mustafa","Interactive Urdu Braille Learning System for Parents of Visually Impaired Students",2017,"Braille literacy is one of the core pillars of education for visually impaired children. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of Braille for Visually impaired children by suggesting that students who read Braille outside of the classroom have higher reading speed and fluency. In resource constrained countries, such as Pakistan, the visually impaired students may acquire the knowledge of Urdu Braille at special education schools. However, there is a dearth of resources for the parents of such children, when it comes to learning Urdu Braille. Therefore, we designed a web-based Urdu Braille Translator and interactive Braille learning tool to enhance the Urdu Braille learning experience for parents of visually impaired. The usability study of this tool was conducted with 15 parents of the visually impaired students.","Yes","Accommodation","Web-based Urdu Braille Translator and learning tool","Learning","N/A","15","Pakistan","Urdu Braille","N/A"

Part 2: visually impaired children",2019,"The purpose of this study was to implement an educational programme for oral hygiene for visually impaired children. It involved 30 children with total blindness aged 7-14 years: 13 boys and 17 girls. For their training, specially designed training materials were made, including magnified gypsum teeth models with and without cavities resembling carious lesions, Braille instructions for oral hygiene and embossed images printed out on special microcapsule paper presenting the sequence of the toothbrushing movements. To facilitate the maintenance of oral hygiene at home, a special CD with children's favourite music was made, divided into fragments by a bell ring that indicates the time to change the area to be toothbrushed. The music meets the time required to clean all the tooth surfaces for three minutes. The oral hygiene level was assessed using the Greene and Vermillion - Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. The approved one-year oral hygiene educational programme showed a significant improvement in the oral hygiene habits of the visually impaired children. There was a slow improvement in the oral hygiene levels in the first month. The trend continued until the end of the one-year period, the results obtained being statistically significant compared to the baseline.

The blocks transmit Infrared codes when come in contact with the system. The Braille Blocks System consists of a battery, optical detectors and controller which performs detection and processing of selected IR pattern. This system comprises of three different learning modules namely Words Game, Shapes Game and Math Game. These modules are further divided into several sub-game sections so that the children can learn and improve their communication and academic skills. The presence of audio feedback elevates a child's capabilities to memorize and concentrate on self-learning and spatial coordination in a fascinating way. The designed system was tested on 20 blind children in National Special Education Complex Karachi, Pakistan and an assessment was conducted on basis of different types of errors encountered by children.

This article gives an analysis of what a good automatic Braille transcribing tool should propose to be suitable for inclusive education. We criticize actual technologies and we present NAT Braille, a free software solution designed to respond to pedagogical specific needs. Main content. We describe the situation of inclusive education for visually-impaired students in France and recall the main existing solutions. We then focus on two major facts : most teachers are not skilled in Braille and only few solutions are designed to teach Braille inside a classroom. Moreover, teachers and students need to communicate directly without the support of transcribing centers, which produce high quality transcriptions but are inadequate during a lesson or to communicate for students working together. NAT Braille is a transcribing tool that has been designed to limit the time disability which is prejudicial to the visually impaired, especially during the learning process. It includes features allowing teachers to transcribe automatically composite documents according to pedagogical scenarios, particularly while learning contracted Braille (there are different steps corresponding to the student's level in contracted Braille, also usable by a non Braille reading teacher). It contains a simple Braille and black interface where students and teacher may interact directly and produce instant Braille to black or black to Braille transcriptions, including mathematical and contracted Braille ones. Therefore NAT Braille allows immediate corrections, group work and mutual assistance between students. Moreover users can read and write with their own modalities and language. NAT Braille uses a highly customizable set of rules instead of dictionaries, and adapts to each profile. Results. NAT Braille has been tested in real environments and will now be widely distributed into classes. Feedbacks are promising and raise new challenges, especially to make the software even more simple to use. Some features could be combined with other existing solutions to improve the understanding of formulas, to ease the transcriptions' edition or to include NAT Braille in publishing chains in order to produce adaptable documents. Conclusion. We show that NAT Braille is a good solution for inclusive education, particularly in the case of non Braille reading teachers. In this idea we are developing foreign partnerships to propose NAT Braille into other languages. However it remains a tool and would be advantaged if combined with other assistive solutions.

In the present study we intend to compare the spelling performance of visually impaired individuals (both individuals who are blind and individuals with low vision) with that of their fully sighted peers. An analysis of errors (misspelled words and spelling mistakes) was conducted. The influence of certain factors - such as gender, age, educational level and the most common medium of reading - over spelling performance was also assessed. Our results suggest that the severity of the visual disability appears to have a negative effect on the spelling performance of visually impaired adults, although the number of errors declines as the subject's level of education increases. Blind or severely visually impaired subjects who used braille frequently seem to perform better at spelling compared to those who rely on other media. Adults with low vision who use magnifying lenses frequently seem to make more spelling mistakes than those who use braille, large print, CCTV or the computer (screen-reading or screen-magnification software).","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Spelling","N/A"

It is a well-known fact that for the visually impaired it is not possible to access the information via drawings and figures, as there is no interpretation. In addition, it is not easy to search through a passage for the relevant information as Braille takes much more time to read and finally a lot of memorization is necessary in order to achieve success in life. As standard procedures and systems for education are not sufficient for these people, a novel approach is necessary. The recent advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have placed e-learning at the front row of education methodologies for the disabled. E-learning applications and websites specifically designed for accessibility help to improve the quality of the education without undermining the functionality and the usability.

However, it becomes complicated and challenging if the teacher has to teach pre-reading skills to Grade R learners with visual impairments. In light of this challenge, researchers have endeavoured to determine the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) that teachers should possess for the effective teaching of reading in classrooms with visually impaired learners. Aim: This article explores a small sample of in-service teachers' knowledge of using Braille to teach pre-reading skills to Grade R learners with visual impairments. Setting: The study was conducted in a School for the Blind in Maseru, Lesotho, where three Grade R in-service teachers teaching learners with visual impairments were purposively sampled. Methods: This study is underpinned by Koehler and Mishra's theory of TPACK. An interpretivist, qualitative small-scale case study approach was employed, using semi-structured interviews and classroom observations. Document analysis was also used to corroborate findings. Results: Findings reveal that although some of the participants possess a high level of technological knowledge, they tend to teach Braille as a 'stand-alone' skill and fail to integrate it with the teaching of other pre-reading skills to Grade R learners. Conclusion: In-service teachers showed limited knowledge of some of the essential skills for teaching pre-reading skills to Grade R learners who are visually impaired. The study calls for supportive in-service teacher education programmes that equip Grade R teachers of learners with visual impairments with the necessary skills to teach pre-reading skills.","Yes","Accommodation","Braille","Classroom","Grade R","Three","Lesotho","Pre-reading skills","N/A"

VIML was led at the UCL Institute of Education, London, UK and supported by the Royal Academy of Music, London, and Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) UK, starting in 2013 and concluding in 2015. It sourced insider perspectives from 225 adult blind and partially-sighted musicians/music teachers, and 6 sighted music teachers, through life history interviews and an international questionnaire, which collected quantitative and qualitative data. Through articulating a range of insider voices, this article examines some issues, as construed by respondents, around educational equality and inclusion in music for visually-impaired children and adults in relation to three main areas: the provision of mainstream schooling versus special schools; pedagogy, including the preparedness of teachers to respond to the needs of visually-impaired learners; and the educational role of notation, focusing particularly on Braille as well as other print media. The investigation found multifaceted perspectives on the merits of visually-impaired children being educated in either mainstream or special educational contexts. These related to matters such as access to specific learning opportunities, a lack of understanding of visually-impaired musicians' learning processes (including accessible technologies and score media) in mainstream contexts, and concerns about the knowledge of music educators in relation to visual impairment. Regarding pedagogy, there were challenges raised, but also helpful areas for sighted music educators to consider, such as differentiation by sight condition and approach, and the varying roles of gesture, language, light and touch.

This study tackles the challenge by utilizing both Braille joint training and pre -trained language models to conduct analogy learning and transfer learning on a substantial volume of readily available data. The method of Braille joint training also establishes a universal language model in the Braille domain, capable of simultaneously performing multiple tasks like Braille-Chinese translation, Chinese-Braille translation, Braille word segmentation, etc. This greatly caters to users' requirements for Braille information processing while also mitigating extensive deployment expenses associated with multiple models. Furthermore, we put forward a Braille phoneme recognition translation approach distinct from conventional Braille-Chinese translation methodologies.

Methods: In concert with a focus group of practitioners, CASAS and the American Printing House for the Blind selected 25 test items in a life and work context that were previously field-tested with approximately 30,000 sighted adult education students. These test items were adapted for a contracted braille format. Both qualitative data and statistical data were collected during and after the braille reading test was field-tested. Results: Sixty-five youths and adults, about 50% of whom were aged 18 or younger, participated in the field testing of the CASAS braille reading test between September 2005 and April 2007. The scale-score range for the braille test was slightly lower than for a similar version in the print format. No significant difference was found between the adults who were visually impaired (those who were blind or had low vision-braille readers) who took the braille test and the sighted adults who took a print version of the brailled test items. Discussion: Valuable suggestions for constructing and administering braille tests were made as a result of the study. New braille assessments will incorporate refreshable braille displays to allow test takers to gain better access to more information and the computing environment. Implications for practitioners: The results support the value of customizing a reading test in a braille format to ensure realistic tasks in the lives and work of adult students who are visually impaired. Hard-copy braille will remain important in future standardized assessments, as will options that offer computer delivery with universal design features.","Yes","Accommodation","Braille reading test","Assessment","Adult education","65","N/A","Life and work skills","N/A"

Many studies have emerged in the field of Information and Communication Technology on visually impaired (VIP) learners using computer-based software programs. With regard to this impact, vocabulary has been given particular emphasis in learning English as a foreign language or second language. Previously, most visually impaired learners were not aware of the learning opportunities to overcome their disability. Recently, learners have been able to study both in special education and inclusive education for partially sighted learners, but the instructional materials and assistive tools have some drawbacks. Textbooks with Braille codes and CDs with a daisy-digital accessible information system have not been easily available to these learners. Furthermore, the contents of standard textbooks did not provide such learners with any assistance. As there have not been any studies on these learners in Thailand, the purpose of this study is to identify the challenges and needs of visually impaired learners of English. This study is a part of a more extensive research program conducted to create assistive technology and tools for young visually impaired Thai learners of English. This paper will focus on multi-sensory material of English vocabulary in special education which will emphasize the development of assistive technology or tools with touch and sound senses in English vocabulary for young VIP learners to encourage sustained learning.","Yes","Accommodation","Multi-sensory material with touch and sound","Learning, classroom","Young learners","N/A","Thailand","English vocabulary","N/A"

Oral hygiene practices among visually impaired children require a special approach with time and patience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral health education and fluoridated dentifrices on the oral health status of visually impaired children. Materials and Methods: Fifty visually impaired children between 8 and 12 years of age formed the study group. Oral health education and motivation was done with the help of Braille. Modified Bass method of brushing was taught to the children and the required dental treatment was done. Subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups fluoridated and non-fluoridated. Oral hygiene index -simplified, DMFT, deft index, and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus count were assessed at baseline, immediately after the treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals. The oral health awareness was assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study. Results: At baseline, the mean OHI-S, DMFT and deft scores were 2.72, 0.47, and 0.51 respectively. At the end of 12 months there was a significant decrease in OHI-S scores in the fluoridated group. No significant difference was seen in DMFT and deft between the fluoridated and non-fluoridated groups at the different time interval. After the oral health education and comprehensive treatment there was a reduction in Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts in both groups; however, at the end of 3, 6, 12 months there was a significant decrease in fluoridated group as compared to the non-fluoridated. The oral health awareness increased significantly at the end of the study. Conclusion: The oral health education and motivation formulated for the visually impaired children was effective in improving their oral health status. Fluoridated dentifrices decreased the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts and improved the oral hygiene status.","Yes","Accommodation","Braille and Modified Bass method","N/A","Elementary","50","N/A","Oral health","N/A"

Methods: Twenty-one visually impaired Greek school-aged children participated in the present study. The students who participated were enrolled in different educational settings; that is, special schools and mainstream educational settings. The research tool was a subset (three subscales) of a standardized instrument (Test A, Padeliadu & Antoniou, 2008) that evaluates reading accuracy in Greek. All interactions between researchers and students were video-taped, and the analysis of the obtained data was focused on phonological and nonphonological-type errors. Results: Significant differences in performance were found between male and female participants-t(19) = 2.12, p < .05-as well as between students who attained primary and secondary education: t(19) = 1.96, p congruent to .05. The average number of errors in the three subscales correlated very highly, signifying that performance was very similar. Positive correlation was found between replacement and subtraction types of error (p < .05), and replacement and recognition (p < .001), and the total number of errors was positively correlated with replacement (p < .001), subtraction (p = .001), and recognition errors (p < .001). Male participants made more replacement errors: t(19) = 2.09, p congruent to .05; participants in secondary education made significantly fewer errors of recognition: t(19) < 2.49, p < .05; and students who were congenitally blind made significantly more errors of addition: t(19) = 1.96, p congruent to .05. Regarding the recognition type of error, there was a significant interaction effect between grade and age at loss of vision: F(3/17) = 3.09, p = .05. Discussion: Participants did not benefit exceptionally from semantic information, and it is unclear whether a higher school level leads to the improvement of braille reading accuracy. Reading the entire word seems the most effective decoding strategy. Nevertheless, further research is needed to obtain relevant data from longitudinal studies. Implications for practitioners: Listing and analyzing braille reading errors systematically may reveal error patterns. Based on these patterns, teachers would be able to differentiate their instruction to improve students' performances in braille speed and accuracy.","Yes","Not","N/A","N/A","Primary and secondary","Twenty-one","Greece","Braille reading","N/A"

AsteriX-BVI a publicly accessible web server, developed at the Radboud University in the Netherlands already allows BVI scientists to perform a complete series of tasks to automatically manage results of quantum chemical calculations and produce a 3D representation of the optimized structures into a 3D printable, haptic-enhanced format that includes Braille annotations. We report here the implementation of Molecular Fabricator 1.0, a molecular editor which is a new assistive feature of AsteriX-BVI. This molecular editor allows BVI scientists to conceptualize complex organic molecules in their mind and subsequently create them via the server. It was developed around the concept that molecules are composed of chemical fragments connected together. Fragments from either a predefined dictionary or defined as short SMILES strings can be used, ensuring that almost any structure can be generated. A fragment-based relative atom-numbering scheme that can be mentally tracked is used together with the support of an automatically generated report in Braille providing topological information and a clean 2D sketch of the constructed molecule, that can be unambiguously recognized tactilely. The R or S stereochemical configuration of asymmetric centers is controlled via feedback provided in the Braille report. The molecular fabricator creates output files in a variety of formats currently used in drug design and theoretical chemistry. It was tested and refined with the help of HBW, the blind co-author of this article, who pursues a PhD in chemistry at UC Davis, California. With Molecular Fabricator 1.0 HBW can now create molecules very fast and verify their structures without external help as was the case before.

Objective: We proposed the use of 3D-printed models to allow the societal inclusion of visually impaired or blind expectant parents. Patient involvement: Visually impaired expectant parents were proposed to touch a 3D printed sensory vector of their prenatal classic ultrasonography. Methods: After a classic ultrasound assessment was performed, selected volumes were processed and 3D-printed with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Patient satisfaction was recorded after they manipulated the models. Results: A total of 42 prenatal 3D prints were for 12 expectant parents, used during 20 ultrasonographic sessions with visually impaired or blind expectant parents. During 13 of them (65%), it was the mother who was affected by a visual loss whereas the father was the parent affected by the disability during 7 sessions (35%). The parent affected by the disability was congenitally blind and Braille-reader in 9 ultrasonography sessions (45%). All expectant visually impaired or blind parents expressed very significant satisfaction with the use of 3D models for inclusive use. Discussion: We have shown that acrylonitrile butadiene styrene-printed models improve the sonographic experience of visually impaired or blind expectant parents. They can thereby perform their own mental representation process by extrapolating sensory information obtained from the 3D tactile support. Practical value: These low-cost 3D-printed models improve the inclusion of visually impaired or blind expectant parents, by offering them a sensory vector of information. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To help answer this question, we developed a survey. Methods: An online survey instrument was distributed through O&M electronic discussion groups. The survey included a demographic section, a section concerning the use of braille for instructional purposes, questions about the importance of braille in the training and certification of O&M specialists, the level of knowledge of braille required, and whether or not respondents considered braille an essential job function. Results: Most participants (n = I 08) believed or strongly believed that braille should be a separate course in personnel preparation programs and should be required for O&M personnel preparation programs accredited by the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired (AER). Slightly less than half (42%) of respondents believed or strongly believed that braille should be required for Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation and Education Professionals (ACVREP) certification in O&M (n = 80; 22 respondents were undecided). Discussion: The field of visual impairment (i.e., blindness or low vision) needs to examine closely the amount of time, number of personnel required, and financial cost of pursuing braille as a competency for O&M specialists. Personnel costs may include additional resources to assist ACVREP in changing its requirements to include braille and the revision of the examination to reflect this new requirement, universities in hiring faculty to develop new programs of study to include coursework involving braille, and AER's Higher Education Accreditation Commission in changing the AER University Review Accreditation Curricular Standards: Orientation and Mobility Specialists. Implications for practitioners: This study provided a snapshot of what a group (N = 1 89) of vision professionals believe regarding the importance of braille in O&M-141 of that group were certified in O & M; the remainder identified themselves as having multiple certifications.

The present study was conducted to educate and motivate visually impaired children to maintain their oral health using specially designed methods that are easy for these children to understand. Additionally, the study evaluated the effectiveness of these methods over a 6-month period. MethodologyThe investigation was done on 148 visually impaired children who were residents of two institutes for the visually impaired. The efficacy of a specially designed oral health education programme and two different motivational techniques utilising tactile (Group I: braille+plastic models) or auditory sensations (Group II: audio story+JAWS((R)), i.e. Job Access With Speech) was evaluated over 6months based on the children's plaque and gingival scores. ResultsSignificant improvement in mean plaque and gingival scores was evident in both the groups at the 6-month evaluation, validating the effectiveness of both the programmes. In Group I, the mean plaque score decreased from 1.340.29 at baseline to 1.09 +/- 0.26 at 3months, with a further decrease to 1.04 +/- 0.31 at 6months post-implementation (P<0.01). The mean plaque score in Group II decreased from 1.24 +/- 0.47 at baseline to 1.15 +/- 0.15 at 3months (P=0.12), and further to 1.10 +/- 0.17 at 6months (P<0.01) post-implementation of the educational programme. At baseline, 87.8% of the children in Group I had moderate gingivitis, whereas 52.7% of the children in Group II belonged to the mild category. At the end of 6months, 52.7% of the children in Group I were in the mild category, and 62.2% children in Group II were in the moderate category.

These tools do not fully and adequately meet the needs of the teachers because they are long to produce, expensive, and not versatile enough to provide rapid updating of the content. For instance, the same RLM can barely be used during different lessons. In addition, those maps do not provide any interactivity, which reduces students' autonomy. With the emergence of 3D printing and low-cost microcontrollers, it is now easy to design affordable interactive small-scale models (SSMs) which are adapted to the needs of special education teachers. However, no study has previously been conducted to evaluate non-visual learning using interactive SSMs. In collaboration with a specialized teacher, we designed a SSM and a RLM representing the evolution of the geography and history of a fictitious kingdom. The two conditions were compared in a study with 24 visually impaired students regarding the memorization of the spatial layout and historical contents. The study showed that the interactive SSM improved both space and text memorization as compared to the RLM with braille legend. In conclusion, we argue that affordable home-made interactive small scale models can improve learning for visually impaired students.

Globally, there are 150 million children who are physically challenged, and they are often deprived of education because they are the most vulnerable and excluded people in their respective community. Inclusion implies that no one should be left out of the education system as education is the key to success. All students who are otherwise capable, in whatsoever way, should have access to proper education and training. Proper education and training for the twenty first century would be much more geared toward encouraging learners toward critical thinking, problem solving, analysis, interpretation of information and creativity. Learners are expected to play a predominant role, whereas the teacher will be doing less instruction but much more orchestration of information. Learners who are visually impaired, nowadays, have access to a number of technologies that can facilitate the learning process. During the last decade, learners have been using smartphones, which has grown significantly, in their everyday life. Learners are regularly encouraged to use their personal devices for learning processes. In addition, the majority of mobile learning applications do not make the most of the smartphones, which have interesting features such as Accelerometer and Gyroscope.

We aimed to compare the effectiveness of oral health education using Audio Tactile Performance (ATP) technique alone, ATP combined with oral health education for mothers, and ATP along with art package on the oral health status of visually impaired children. Materials and methods This cluster, randomized trial, included visually impaired children from preschool to 10th grade (32 classes, n = 200), in Tehran, Iran, in 2018-2019. A questionnaire was filled out through face to face interviews at baseline regarding age, gender, status of visual impairment, and place of residence. The Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and Bleeding on Probing (BOP) were examined afterward. Classes were randomly assigned to three groups through simple randomization: 1. Art group (ATP, game-based, and music-based education (11 classes, n = 66); 2. Mothers group (children received ATP and their mothers received education by telephone (10 classes, n = 73); and 3. Control group (children received ATP (11 classes, n = 61). Children received reinforcement after 1 and 2 weeks. Follow-up oral examinations were performed after 1 and 2 months by a blind calibrated examiner. Descriptive statistics were performed using Chi-Square, and ANOVA tests by SPSS (version 22). In analytic statistics, two-level mixed-effects models for BOP and OHI-S were fitted using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4. Both models fitted with the grouping variable and time (baseline, 1, and 2 months after interventions) as the fixed effects. Results The mean age (SD) of the children was 12.29 (3.45) years (range: 6-17). Male children (67%) more than female children (33%) participated in the study.

Haptic systems generally need expensive equipment and support from sighted teachers. Moreover, the learning has always been carried out with letters of different alphabets mapped into some tactile pattern. Writing is a big concern for the visually impaired as most official work, like signing, is still carried out by conventional handwriting methods. Most of the existing systems are limited to teaching a single language's alphabet and basic grammar or may not provide feedback to let the learners know of their learning progress. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to develop an efficient system that includes voice-over guidance to teach writing in multiple alphabets to visually impaired people and to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. As such, a system was developed for teaching multilingual alphabets to visually impaired people with voice instructions. With the aid of a voice-over guide, learners were able to write letters with a stylus on a graphics pad. The progress assessment of the learners is carried out by an image processing algorithm and scored by a machine learning (ML) model. The Random Forest model was used due to its high accuracy (f1-score of 99.8% on test data) among the existing ten different ML algorithms. Finally, the performance and usability of this system were evaluated through an empirical study replicated with 16 participants, including four teachers and twelve visually impaired people.

In this short paper we will announce the targets and the way of accomplishing the tasks in our current project MathInBraille. 60 years since the invention of the computer and after 30 years of successful use of Braille display and speech output, there are still difficulties for blind and visually impaired persons to access scientific documents or school books containing mathematical formulae. The main reason for these difficulties lies in the visual 2D character of the mathematical presentation that is in conflict with the linear nature of Braille and speech output. The existence of many different, language bound mathematical Braille codes is also a barrier for an universal Braille access to science. MathInBraille project wants to contribute to overcoming this part of the digital divide by offering an online portal for converting eDocuments with mathematical contents into Braille and speech formats. The main target group of the project are blind and visually impaired pupils, students and other persons interested in school and/or scientific materials containing mathematics. Main Content. The paper will outline the plan of setting up a portal for conversion of mathematic formula and documents into well defined math notations for blind readers. It will outline the plans and the workflow of the protal. Results. The MathInBraille online service will be free of charge and no kind of personal user data will be collected. It should allow those confronted with accessing math in accessible notations and those in charge of providing services for blind people (e.g. inclusive education) to easily convert standard math content (e.g. in MathML or TeX/LaTeX) into Braille and audio formats. The project is funded by the Internet Foundation Austria (IPA) [1] and will be carried out by the Institute Integriert Studieren [2] of the Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Austria. Its duration is from February to October 2011. Conclusions. This paper presents the concept of an open portal for math conversion into accessible formats for blind people. It will also outline the need to work towards a universal math notation for the target group to allow better and more sustainable international co-operation in providing access to math content.","Yes","Accommodation","Online portal for converting math to Braille/audio","N/A","Pupils, students, and interested persons","N/A","Austria","Mathematics","N/A"

Graphical interfaces have become one of the biggest obstacles for visually impaired programming professionals. The same problems that relate to visually impaired programmers also apply to programming education in which it is very challenging to make educational interfaces accessible for visually impaired and for other students with disabilities. In order to make programming more suitable for students with visual impairment an educational system that enables voice-based control of its elements has been developed for the purpose of their programming education. The results of using this kind of system and its impact on visually impaired students are presented and discussed in this paper.","Yes","Accommodation","Voice-based control system","Programming education","N/A","N/A","N/A","Programming","N/A"

Three live demonstrations of educative applications.",2018,"In this demonstration we showcase a new spatial augmented reality device (interactive projection) with three applications: education and experimentation of color models, map exploration for visually impaired people and scientific vulgarization of machine learning. The first exhibition is an interactive exploration about the nature of light. Visitors can experiment with additive subtractive color models. We engage them with questions, and they have to reply using cards to find out answers. This exhibit is suitable for children. The second exhibition is about map exploration and creation for Visually Impaired Persons (VIP). VIP generally use tactile maps with braille to learn about an unknown environment. However, these maps are not accessible to the 80% of VIP who don't read braille. Our prototype augments raised-line maps with audio output. The third exhibition is destined to be used for scientific outreach. It enables the creation of artificial neural networks (ANN) using tangible interfaces. Neurons are represented by laser-cut diamond shaped tokens, and the data to learn is printed on cards. The ANN learns to differentiate shapes, and the whole learning process is made visible and interactive. These three applications demonstrate the capabilities of our hardware and software development kit in different scenarios.

In the interviews, students described the effects of various teaching methods on their learning and evaluated the social aspect (broadly speaking) of inclusive education. The results show that while the social needs of visually impaired Turkish students were adequately met through inclusive education, their academic needs were not, which we speculate to be partly because of mathematics teachers' negative attitudes towards inclusive education.","Yes","Not","N/A","N/A","High school","Three","Turkey","Mathematics","N/A"

In this instance, life histories were co-constructed narratives - foci were the self-identities of this unique group and insider' perspectives on education, musical participation and society. Analytic induction of the biographies revealed that a perceived barrier to lifelong learning was having the ability to read notation, either adapted print or in Braille format, and the access to educators who had expertise to teach musicians with visual impairments. The respondents commented on the great value of ensemble participation and adopting teaching roles too. With widespread lore in society about the exceptional musical abilities of those with visual impairment, longstanding traditions of blind musicianship, plus evidence of distinct neural development and hearing, they acknowledged the cachet associated with blind musicians but, regardless, wished to be considered musicians first and foremost.

Objective: To analyze the scientific production on educational inclusion of the visually impaired, specifically concerning the continuation within higher education institutions. Method: Integrated literature review in publicly accessible virtual environments, such as Brazil's Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), by combining the tecnologia assistiva e deficiencia visual. Results: 21 articles were identified, organized, and analyzed, enabling the identification of one category: access and continuation of visually impaired students within higher education; and two subcategories: teacher training aimed at working with visually impaired students and availability of material resources at higher education institutions. Conclusion: The analysis of the resources indicates that, although access to higher education for people with disabilities is legally protected, actual inclusion is necessary within institutions.

In spite of the support extended by higher education institutions towards inclusion, there is a substantial exclusion of visually impaired learners in engineering courses in South Africa. This indicates that there is a lack of an effective framework that guides institutions in South Africa to promote the provision of visually impaired learners in engineering. The purpose of this paper is to firstly obtain the perceptions of visually impaired learners from special schools in the Free State Province regarding the provision of visually impaired learners for engineering education. Secondly, the paper aims to investigate which ICT tools can be used to overcome some of the challenges that visually impaired learners may face in engineering education. Focus groups were used to collect qualitative data from visually impaired learners in the Free State Province of South Africa. The lack of awareness about engineering and the lack of engineering tools were some of the key challenges raised. ICT tools such as iNETSim, AudioMath, PRISCA, LoggerPro, MoodleVox etc. are recommended for specific engineering courses. It is further recommended that tertiary institutions seek to address the challenges faced by visually impaired learners, so that they too may contribute to the socio-economic development of South Africa.

This may allow them to attend normal schools and to be integrated into society, which has lifelong benefits. Yet, in Africa, many visually impaired children are enrolled in special schools and taught only Braille. The purpose of this analysis was to document the extent of inappropriate enrolment of visually impaired children in special schools and annexes for the blind in four African countries. Methods: Schools were selected through a population-proportional-to-size method so that they would represent all children attending special schools in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. Children were examined by ophthalmologists trained in standardised methods to determine visual acuity and the cause of decreased acuity. Results: Of 1062 children examined in special schools and annexes for the blind, 361 (34%, 95% CI 31.2, 36.8) had visual acuity >= 6/60; the most common cause of visual impairment was retinal disease.

Visually impaired people say that they should be involved in the planning and delivery of the activities. Visually impaired people are concerned that if they are not involved, the activities may reinforce negative attitudes about them. Some visually impaired people say that teachers should not use touch to teach visually impaired pupils. Others say that touch is important for supporting learning and preventing injury. If touch is used to teach visually impaired pupils, when and how it is used must be decided by the visually impaired pupil and discussed with the teacher. Visually impaired people are concerned that grouping pupils in relation to 'ability' may result in exclusion. Disability simulations have developed as a popular professional development tool to help increase knowledge and awareness of disability and facilitate pedagogical learning among prospective and pre-service teachers. The aim of this research is to explore the ethics of sighted people simulating visual impairment from the perspective of visually impaired people. Participants were nine visually impaired adults who read vignettes narrating simulation experiences of prospective physical education teachers in a university setting before being interviewed about their perceptions of what they had read. Interviews were conducted via telephone, and were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis.

Theoretically, integration of visually impaired persons in schools especially higher institution of learning in Nigeria seems to be working, but in practical terms, educational opportunities are not being equalised because modern technologies and facilities that could ease integration are in short supply. Diffusion of Innovation theory, Knowledge Gaps theory and Democratic-participant theory are used as theoretical framework for the study. Using descriptive survey design, visually impaired persons from Vocational Training Centre for the blind (VTC), Oshodi, Lagos and Anglo-Welfare Association for the Blind (ANWAB), Yaba, Lagos were interviewed via self-administered questionnaire complemented with Key Informant Interview. The study revealed that computer literacy is very important to visually impaired persons and that visually impaired persons in Lagos State had to undergo formal training to acquire relevant computer and Information communication Technology (ICT) related skills. Though communication needs of the respondents are met by these assistive technologies but the visually impaired persons encounter basic problems when using the computer and mobile phones, like non identification of icons, financial incapacity, and a lot of times environmental challenges prevailing in developing countries. The study also revealed that the effectiveness level of these ICT devices (the computer and mobile phones) is low as a result of the low compatibility level that these devices have with the visually impaired persons thereby making it difficult for them to integrate fully into the educational system in Nigeria. It was therefore recommended that adequate steps should be taken by the various institutional education boards in ensuring the availability and accessibility of these devices to enhance the education of the virtually impaired persons and improve the standard of inclusive education in Nigeria.","Yes","Accommodation","Computer and mobile phone technologies","N/A","Higher education","N/A","Nigeria, Lagos State","Special education","Yes, visually impaired persons in Lagos"

Such patients-deserve, and health care professionals must provide, equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from their health care in a safe environment. A search of the literature yielded information on the needs of visually impaired people but failed to find a comprehensive program that health care facilities could use to meet the needs of this vulnerable population. This gap in the literature on visually impaired patients (VIPs) and implications for their care led us to conduct focused meetings with this population. Objective: The specific aims of this quality improvement (QI) project were to determine the needs of hospitalized VIPs, develop educational and other resources that would help clinicians and ancillary hospital staff in their interactions with VIPs, and assemble a toolbox of useful materials for VIPs themselves. Methods: A VIP care team identified the needs of VIPs as reported in the literature and in personal meetings with visually impaired people in the community. The team also surveyed interdisciplinary hospital staff members to determine their experience in caring for VIPs as well as their educational needs, and then developed strategies and educational modules to help clinicians and ancillary staff members accommodate the unique needs of VIPs in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The team also assembled a VIP toolbox that contained several items useful to VIPs themselves. Supplementary information tailored to the function of each hospital department (such as nursing, admissions, environmental services, dietary, and radiology) was also provided to help staff members improve VIPs' hospital experience. Results: The hospital's interdisciplinary staff members participated in an education program to improve their care of VIPs. Before the program, only 23.6% of 161 staff members reported having received education on caring for VIPs. After the program, however, 56.4% of 140 staff members reported having received such education. Former patients requested bracelets and room identifiers that would alert staff members to VIPs' needs, and the team provided these. The team also introduced a braille version of the hospital menu and provided VIP toolboxes at each nursing station that contained many useful daily care items. Conclusions: VIPs have specific needs when hospitalized. Patients' and staff members' responses to this QI project were overwhelmingly positive; both groups were appreciative of the newly implemented initiatives to meet the special needs of the visually impaired.","No","Not","Educational resources, VIP toolbox, braille menu","Hospital","N/A","161 staff members","N/A","N/A","Yes, 140 staff members"

It was conducted in 14 regions using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data were generated from a sample of 19 heads of school, 103 students, and 77 teachers. The findings of the study show that the books are appropriate for students with visual impairment. However, they lacked enough tactile illustrations and pictures. Further findings revealed that lack of braille knowledge among some teachers limited them from using the books. As such, a few teachers who had braille knowledge had started to use the books while those with limited knowledge did not. Most teachers reported lack of appropriate pedagogy for handling special needs in inclusive classrooms. Therefore, although the books are appropriate, a lot needs to be desired in building teachers' capacity to use the books. Various inclusive methodological knowledge to teachers needs to be ensured. Furthermore, the books must be improved to include more tactile graphics and pictures to make them more reader-friendly for students with visual impairment.

Trained peer tutoring, where a nondisabled student is trained to serve as a peer tutor for a disabled student, is among them. However, little research has been done that engages directly with visually impaired students about their views and experiences with these pedagogical practices. Using belonging as a conceptual lens to guide and inform methodological and data interpretation decisions, our purpose was to elicit the views of visually impaired youth regarding the use of trained peer tutors in integrated physical education classes. Sixteen visually impaired youth completed two interviews about their views toward physical education generally and the concept of peer tutoring specifically. Interviews were conducted via video conference technology, and were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. Three interrelated themes were constructed that depict the participants views toward the concept of peer tutoring: (a) peer tutoring might enhance belonging ... maybe, (b) shouldn't this just happen naturally?, and (c) this is not for me. The themes provide insights into the views of visually impaired youth toward peer tutoring as a strategy that may not be supportive of feelings of belonging within integrated physical education. Rather, participants were largely dismissive of the strategy, suggesting that any help needed within this context should be navigated outside of formal pedagogical strategies that may alienate visually impaired students by identifying them as 'needing help'. These findings support suggestions for physical educators to implement this practice only after first permitting students to engage with friends to navigate physical education spaces, and then only afterwards at the discretion of the student.","Yes","Accommodation","Trained peer tutoring","Classroom","N/A","Sixteen","N/A","Physical education","N/A"

In fact, the supplementary materials are essential to teachers at special education schools who teach blind students by using other senses instead of eyesight. However, it has been a lack of support to provide teaching materials for the purpose so far. Since visually impaired people have learned the color concept in an abstract and literary way, they have had problems in understanding the color theory itself. The main purpose of this study is to design the Tactile-Color system using tactile symbols and texture to explain the color theory. This assistive material was produced by 2.5D embossed UV print materials for visually impaired education. The color symbols were designed based on associations between colors and shapes to help people perceive tactile information; they are primary colors (i.e., red, yellow, blue) matching with primary shapes (i.e., circle, triangle, square), respectively. Brightness and saturation in color theory designated to the tactile texture of softness and roughness gradient. The audio guide also supplied to enhance the efficiency of art teachers' classes and to assist the self-learning of visually impaired students. The survey and interviews were conducted with 17 special education teachers for the evaluation of the tactile-color materials.

Specifically, a gap exists concerning the attitudes of elementary school teachers towards the inclusion of visually impaired children in mainstream schools. This article uses data from two questionnaires, leveraging the responses of 253 teachers from rural and urban areas. The results demonstrate that elementary school teachers commonly hold positive attitudes towards the inclusion of visually impaired children and that teachers' initial and in-service training about inclusion positively influenced their attitudes. Our findings are in contrast with earlier research which argues that teachers do not hold positive attitudes to inclusion, and highlights that a key barrier to inclusion stems from elementary school teachers feeling unprepared to teach visually impaired children. We conclude that greater post-qualification training is required to enable teachers to operationalise different approaches that facilitate the inclusion of visually impaired children.","Yes","N/A","N/A","N/A","Elementary","253","Turkey","N/A","N/A"

Therefore, our group developed experiments and graphical representations that enable visually impaired and blind students to understand enzyme properties. The experiments were done with pineapple bromelain, using reconstituted dry milk and gelatin as substrates. The visualization of the results were based on the sensation of the viscosity of the samples.

Methods: We used a retrospective population-based study design. The health care system is free for all inhabitants in Norway. We included all children that had received braille education the last four decades. From each students record, we abstracted year born, country of birth, gender, year diagnosed, diagnosis, classification of visual impairment and type of reading media. Results: We identified 287 children (137 girls and 150 boys) that had received braille education over the last 40 years. Of these, 262 (91.3%) children were born in Norway, 145 (53.7%) were diagnosed within the first year of life and 59 (20.6%) from age of one to five. The most frequent diagnoses were Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), Juvenile Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (JNCL), Lebers Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP).

This schooling system remains a subject of excessive debate among those interested in this field of study. This debate is part of an ongoing conversation and discussion on the merits and demerits of integrating disabled children with non-disabled peers at regular schools. This study aimed to answer three main questions pertaining to this subject. The first one tackles whether the placement of visually impaired students in specialized schools for the blind in Sudan (henceforth specialized schools) serves their education best. The second compares the advantages and disadvantages of integrating this group of students into regular schools as opposed to separating them into specialized schools. The third question is concerned with the competencies which the teachers at the Sudanese General Basic School should have in order to fulfill the requirements of the inclusive education setting. Interviews were conducted with a group of 20 participants; 10 of these were students who joined schools for the blind and regular schools in Sudan, while the remaining participants were teachers and personnel in the field of education for the visually impaired in Sudan. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview data, which revealed that students with visual impairment, teachers who work in specialized schools, and the group of special education officials who participated in this study were in favor of inclusive education at regular schools after securing the necessary educational needs for these students to access school curricula equal to their sighted peers.

It was thought massage practitioners with visual impairment did not suffer burnout and depression because their mean scores indicated no problem. However, their mean score for anxiety was high compared with previous studies. Gender and level of education showed no significant differences on anxiety and depression. Higher scores for anxiety and depression correlated inversely with age. Scores of depersonalization, anxiety, and depression were significantly higher and those of personal accomplishment lower for unmarried subjects compared to those who were married. Scores of emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and depression were significantly higher in persons who were able to read written text compared to those who read Braille only. Massage practitioners with visual impairment working at hospitals, medical clinics, and nursing homes revealed significantly higher daily client turnover, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization compared to those who established their own massage clinics. It was thought that massage practitioners who were young and unmarried, had slight visual impairment, high client turnover, hectic relationships between clients, little autonomy at work, and worked at medical-related workplaces were prone to burnout.

However, there is evidence that braille instruction is often circumvented or abandoned early in CRPD nations because it is perceived as an inefficient learning medium for blind students. This perception persists despite insufficient empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of the efficiency of reading versus listening for learning in sighted individuals. We therefore investigated the efficiency of learning written versus spoken words in blind and sighted samples. Participants (23 blind, 20 sighted) studied the written definitions of 70 rare English words in successive rounds, presented in conjunction with written or spoken wordforms. Blind participants learned with equal efficiency across modalities, whereas sighted participants learned spoken words more efficiently.
