The purpose of the current literature review is to {purpose}. Generate search words to retrieve bibliometric data from websites such as Web of Science.

Specifications:
  1. The search words should include all resources aligned with the purpose, while effectively excluding irrelevant resources.

Provide the result in JSON format without delimiters, heading, and explanations.

# Import Data

- The current example data are extracted from Web of Science (WOS).

```{r data}
# import data
data <- xlsx::read.xlsx("savedrecs.xls", sheetIndex = 1)

# filter columns
data_reduced <- data %>% 
    select(Authors, Author.Full.Names, Article.Title, Source.Title, Document.Type, Conference.Title, Conference.Date, Conference.Location, Author.Keywords, Abstract, Affiliations, Publisher, Publication.Date, Publication.Year, Volume, Issue, Start.Page, End.Page)

# Conduct Literature Review

- GPT will do the job for us `r print("\U001F609");print("\U001F44D")`

```{r lr-func, include=FALSE}
literature_review <- function(r_questions, bib_data){
  prom <- glue(
"
The purpose of the current literature review is to answer the 'Research Questions' below. Generate a structured summary using the 'Bibliographic Data' and by following the specifications below.

SPECIFICATION:
  1. Considering both 'Research Questions' and 'Bibliometric Data', determine the structure of summary that you think is most appropriate.
    A. However, while flexibly determining the structure of summary, make sure to exclude introduction and conclusion, and to include reference.
  2. Use APA style for citations (e.g., Author, Year).
  3. Follow the markdown syntax.

Research Questions:{r_questions}
  
Bibliographic Data:
{example_data}

Provide only the summary as an output.

  1. What are the major accommodations currently used for students with blindness and visual impairments (BVI) in classroom settings and large-scale assessments?
  Levels of learning: K-12, Higher Education
  Type (Purposes) of assessment: Larger-scale/Classroom; Performance/Aptitude
  2. How are assistive technologies used in assessing students with BVI in different contexts?
  3. How are modeling and scoring procedures adapted for students with BVI in different contexts?
  4. What are the impacts of these accommodations on the academic performance and assessment experiences of students with BVI?
  5. What gaps exist in the current literature regarding assessment accommodations for students with BVI?
