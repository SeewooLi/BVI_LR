1. What are the major accommodations currently used for students with BVI in classroom settings and large-scale assessments?
  a. Levels of learning: K-12, Higher Education
  b. Type (Purposes) of assessment: Larger-scale/Classroom; Performance/Aptitude
  c. Accommodations for testing for students with visual impairment
    i. What kind: past and now (classroom, standardized tests, large-scale tests)
    ii. Context of being used (Assessment context & Teaching and learning context)
    iii. Studentsâ€™ reactions to the accommodations?
    iv. Impacts of accommodations and Remediations?
  d. how K-12 students with visual impairment get schooling (or learn in schools) in the United States)
2. How are assistive technologies used in assessing students with BVI in different contexts?
3. How are modeling and scoring procedures adapted for students with BVI in different contexts?
4. What are the impacts of these accommodations on the academic performance and assessment experiences of students with BVI?
5. What gaps exist in the current literature regarding assessment accommodations for students with BVI?
  a. Equivalence of braille version and regular version?
